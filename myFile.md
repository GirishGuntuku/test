## Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) 
- architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a 
# microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of 
- decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity. This makes the 
- application easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain become more resilient to architecture erosion.[1] 

- parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective
- services independently.[2] It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring.[3] Microservice-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.[4]
